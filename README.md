# Persona 5 Calculator

This program is a calculator for the fusion of personas in the game Persona 5. 

## Persona 5 and Persona Fusion
Persona 5 was developed by Atlus and released in September 2016 for the Playstation 4 and Playstation 3. In Persona 5, the player collects different “persona,” which are based off of characters from myths or deities from numerous religions. Each persona can be identified by its name, its base level, and its arcana. There are 20 different arcana (ex. Sun, Fool, Emperor) and around 10 persona belong to each arcana. 

Players can fuse together different persona to create a new one. Generally, the result of these fusions are determined by the arcana and base levels of the ingredient personas. 
However, some personas, called “treasure demons,” follow different rules when fused
together with different personas.

Even though it is not difficult to calculate the result of a fusion between two specific persona, knowing all the possible pairs of persona that fuse into a specific persona is impossible without calculating all possible fusions. This is where the calculator may be useful to players.
